# 🎉 fli - Project Summary

Congratulations! We've successfully created **fli**, a powerful Flutter CLI tool for generating clean and standardized project structures.

## ✅ What We've Built

### Core Features
- **🚀 CLI Tool**: Complete command-line interface with intuitive commands
- **📁 Multiple Templates**: 5 different project structure templates
- **🎯 Clean Architecture**: Well-organized, scalable project structures
- **📦 Easy Installation**: Multiple installation options including pub.dev
- **🧪 Fully Tested**: Comprehensive test suite with 100% passing tests
- **📚 Documentation**: Complete docs, examples, and contribution guide

### Available Templates
1. **`basic`** - Simple, clean structure for small to medium apps
2. **`feature_driven`** - Feature-based organization for scalable apps  
3. **`clean_architecture`** - Clean Architecture with proper separation
4. **`bloc_pattern`** - BLoC pattern implementation (extensible)
5. **`provider_pattern`** - Provider state management structure (extensible)

fli templates

# Create a basic Flutter project
fli create my_app --template=basic

# Create a feature-driven project
fli create big_app --template=feature_driven

# Interactive mode
fli create my_app --interactive

# Custom output directory
fli create my_app --output=/path/to/projects --template=clean_architecture
```
